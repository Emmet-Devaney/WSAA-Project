# Air Quality Dash

The aim here is to build a Flask-based web application that allows users to query real-time air quality information for any city using the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API (https://aqicn.org/api/), and view the AQI, main pollutant, and timestamp in a clear, interactive interface.
